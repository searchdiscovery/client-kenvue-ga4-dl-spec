# Welcome to the Kenvue GA4 Data Layer Spec contributing guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Kenvue GA4 Data Layer Spec!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Workflow

When we need to make changes to the spec, we follow this general workflow to ensure changes are in the spirit of the spec, are free from typos and broken links, and have the approval of at least one other contributor:
1. Create a new issue to discuss the approach for the changes
2. Create a branch linked to the issue to group related changes
3. Once changes are ready, create a pull request (PR) linked to the original issue
4. Once the PR is approved by at least one other person, it is merged into main and published to GitHub Pages

### Issues

We use GitHub Issues to centralize discussions around spec changes. Once an issue has been discussed and we're ready to make a change, we open a new branch to modify the spec to address the issue. Branches must be linked to issues so other contributors have the necessary context during the review process.

#### Create a new issue

If you'd like to propose a change to the spec, search to see if there's already an issue. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using the issue form.

#### Solve an issue

Some issues are assigned to certain users. If you see an issue which isn't assigned to anyone, feel free to create a branch and open a PR for it.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes using the UI

You can use the GitHub UI to make small changes such as fixing a typo or a broken link. For larger sets of changes, consider using a codespace or making changes locally.

#### Make changes in a codespace

If you don't have a local git environment on your device, you can use GitHub Codespaces to make larger sets of changes.

#### Make changes locally

If you prefer to make changes locally, you can clone the repo using GitHub Desktop or using the command line. Don't forget to create a new branch — you may not commit directly to the main branch in this repository.

### Commit your changes

Once you're done with your changes, you can commit them to the repo.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with your changes, create a pull request (aka PR) so that others can review them.
- All PRs must have approval from at least one reviewer. This is to reduce the risk that a spec change slips in unnoticed by other contributors.
- Please provide a brief description of your changes so that reviewers know what you changed and why.
- Make sure your PR is linked to the original issue.

### Merging

Once your PR is approved, you may merge it yourself if the approver doesn't do it for you. Your changes will appear on the docs site in ~2–5 minutes.
