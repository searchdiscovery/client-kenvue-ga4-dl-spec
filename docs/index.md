# Kenvue Data Layer Specifications Home

## Overview
This repository contains the necessary specifications to build an Event Driven Data Layer.

## Events
Each file inside the **[events](events/ecommerce/add_payment_info.md)** folder corresponds to a single use case or site event that needs to be implemented.

These will be used to share data with Google Tag Manager on desktop and will be sent directly to Google Analytics 4 on mobile.

## Conventions

### Code samples
We defer to stylistic preferences in the target codebase, but here are the JavaScript conventions we use in our code samples:

- Double quotes instead of single quotes in object properties
- No trailing commas
- Semicolons required

## Questions/Comments
For any questions or comments, please contact charlie.tysse@searchdiscovery.com.
